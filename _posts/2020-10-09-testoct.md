It's a known fact that Windows Certificate Manager does not show the entire list of root certificates trusted by the OS. 
As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates belonging to 122 different organizations. This number keeps growing over time, and is 
considerably higher than other major root stores. For instance, Mozilla trusts just 142 roots belonging to 52 organizations.
