title: Applying alternative trusted root certificate sets to Windows
comments: false
---

As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates issued by 122 different organizations from 47 countries. This number keeps growing over time, and is 
considerably higher than other major root stores. Each of these CAs is given tremendous power over your Internet traffic, so it makes great sense to minimize the number of CAs your computer trusts. An interesting option is to replace the default Windows root CA set with the stricter Mozilla trust list, which includes 142 roots (52 organizations - 21 countries). This is one of the cool features that we've built into RootIQ(*).  

(*) RootIQ is our new root certificate manager for Windows, and a free version is now available.

Coming back super shortly...
