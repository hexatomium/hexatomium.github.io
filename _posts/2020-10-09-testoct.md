title: Applying alternative trusted root certificate sets to Windows

As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates belonging to 122 different organizations from 47 countries. This number keeps growing over time, and is 
considerably higher than other major root stores. By contrast, Mozilla trusts 142 roots (52 organizations), while the more restrictive Google trust store includes just 127 roots (48 organizations). Seeking an intuitive way to make Windows trust those root sets rather than the default CTL, we've built RootIQ (our own root certificate manager) along the way.
